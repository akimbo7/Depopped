# Depopped

An API Wrapper for the reselling app, Depop. Depopped simulates a mobile client, almost perfectly, with the use of Depops private API and mobile User Agents.

#
This lib is currently being made but already has many features such as user scraping, sending chosen users a notification, fetching Depop's current banned word list and much more!

Depopped should also include a DM feature - Currently figuring out how to get this to work. Considering you can DM a user regardless of whether your are following them or not, this should be pretty OP for mass DMing ;)


As Depopped is taking advantge of Depop's **private** api and mimicing a mobile client, there is very little ratelimiting and sanctions are unheard of, even after mass following then unfollowing over 10,000 users LOL.


An example of user scraping:
