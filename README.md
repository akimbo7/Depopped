# Depopped

An API Wrapper for the reselling app, Depop. Depopped simulates a mobile client, almost perfectly, with the use of Depops private API and mobile User Agents.

#
This lib is currently being made but already has many features such as user scraping, sending chosen users a notification, fetching Depop's current banned word list and much more!
